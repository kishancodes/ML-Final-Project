Here I am trying to predict if an individual is susceptible to a heart-stroke.

The data set used can be found below:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

* I am using classification method.
- Resolved age group in Part 1. 
- Label-encoded columns in Part 2.
- Normalized in Part 2.
- Implemented sklearn for linear-RE and decision tree classifier. Linear-RE is not meant for classification. Tried logistic-RE but could not visualize it. Would be glad to learn how to visualize logistic-RE. (In Part 2)
- Used metrics for accuracy instead of model.score in Part 2.
