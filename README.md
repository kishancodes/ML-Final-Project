# ML-Final-Project
CS 4200 SP22 Final Project

Here I am trying to predict if an individual is susceptible to a heart-stroke.

The data set used can be found below:

Right now its just the part 1 of the final project requirments. I will include the document as ML.pdf .

The file is still incomplete from the step of finding relationships and plotting data, and describing the findings.

I had some problem with plotting age chart. Will get it resolves ASAP.
